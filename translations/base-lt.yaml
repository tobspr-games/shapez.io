    shortText: shapez.io is a game about building factories to automate the creation
        and combination of increasingly complex shapes within an infinite map.

    intro: >-
        Shapez.io is a relaxed game in which you have to build factories for the
        automated production of geometric shapes.

        As the level increases, the shapes become more and more complex, and you have to spread out on the infinite map.

        And as if that wasn't enough, you also have to produce exponentially more to satisfy the demands - the only thing that helps is scaling!

        While you only process shapes at the beginning, you have to color them later - for this you have to extract and mix colors!

        Buying the game on Steam gives you access to the full version, but you can also play a demo on shapez.io first and decide later!

    nothernlion_comment: This game is great - I'm having a wonderful time playing,
        and time has flown by.
    notch_comment: Oh crap. I really should sleep, but I think I just figured out
        how to make a computer in shapez.io
    steam_review_comment: This game has stolen my life and I don't want it back.
        Very chill factory game that won't let me stop making my lines more
        efficient.

        instructions:
            - 1. Place <strong>Constant Producers</strong> to provide shapes and
              colors to the player
            - 2. Build one or more shapes you want the player to build later and
              deliver it to one or more <strong>Goal Acceptors</strong>
            - 3. Once a Goal Acceptor receives a shape for a certain amount of
              time, it <strong>saves it as a goal</strong> that the player must
              produce later (Indicated by the <strong>green badge</strong>).
            - 4. Click the <strong>lock button</strong> on a building to disable
              it.
            - 5. Once you click review, your puzzle will be validated and you
              can publish it.
            - 6. Upon release, <strong>all buildings will be removed</strong>
              except for the Producers and Goal Acceptors - That's the part that
              the player is supposed to figure out for themselves, after all :)

            <strong>stacked on top</strong> of the left input!
    reward_splitter:
        title: Splitter/Merger
        desc: You have unlocked a <strong>splitter</strong> variant of the

            delivers the requested shape!<br><br> The HUB outputs the requested
            shape on the wires layer, so all you have to do is to analyze it and
            automatically configure your factory based on that.

    reward_constant_signal:
        title: Constant Signal
        desc: You unlocked the <strong>constant signal</strong> building on the wires
            layer! This is useful to connect it to <strong>item filters</strong>
            for example.<br><br> The constant signal can emit a
            <strong>shape</strong>, <strong>color</strong> or
            <strong>boolean</strong> (1 / 0).
    reward_logic_gates:
        title: Logic Gates

tips:
    - The hub accepts input of any kind, not just the current shape!
    - Make sure your factories are modular - it will pay out!
    - Don't build too close to the hub, or it will be a huge chaos!
    - If stacking does not work, try switching the inputs.
    - You can toggle the belt planner direction by pressing <b>R</b>.
    - Holding <b>CTRL</b> allows dragging of belts without auto-orientation.
    - Ratios stay the same, as long as all upgrades are on the same Tier.
    - Serial execution is more efficient than parallel.
    - You will unlock more variants of buildings later in the game!
    - You can use <b>T</b> to switch between different variants.
    - Symmetry is key!
    - You can weave different tiers of tunnels.
    - Try to build compact factories - it will pay out!
    - The painter has a mirrored variant which you can select with <b>T</b>
    - Having the right building ratios will maximize efficiency.
    - At maximum level, 5 extractors will fill a single belt.
    - Don't forget about tunnels!
    - You don't need to divide up items evenly for full efficiency.
    - Holding <b>SHIFT</b> will activate the belt planner, letting you place
      long lines of belts easily.
    - Cutters always cut vertically, regardless of their orientation.
    - To get white mix all three colors.
    - The storage buffer priorities the first output.
    - Invest time to build repeatable designs - it's worth it!
    - Holding <b>CTRL</b> allows to place multiple buildings.
    - You can hold <b>ALT</b> to invert the direction of placed belts.
    - Efficiency is key!
    - Shape patches that are further away from the hub are more complex.
    - Machines have a limited speed, divide them up for maximum efficiency.
    - Use balancers to maximize your efficiency.
    - Organization is important. Try not to cross conveyors too much.
    - Plan in advance, or it will be a huge chaos!
    - Don't remove your old factories! You'll need them to unlock upgrades.
    - Try beating level 20 on your own before seeking for help!
    - Don't complicate things, try to stay simple and you'll go far.
    - You may need to re-use factories later in the game. Plan your factories to
      be re-usable.
    - Sometimes, you can find a needed shape in the map without creating it with
      stackers.
    - Full windmills / pinwheels can never spawn naturally.
    - Color your shapes before cutting for maximum efficiency.
    - With modules, space is merely a perception; a concern for mortal men.
    - Make a separate blueprint factory. They're important for modules.
    - Have a closer look on the color mixer, and your questions will be answered.
    - Use <b>CTRL</b> + Click to select an area.
    - Building too close to the hub can get in the way of later projects.
    - The pin icon next to each shape in the upgrade list pins it to the screen.
    - Mix all primary colors together to make white!
    - You have an infinite map, don't cramp your factory, expand!
    - Also try Factorio! It's my favorite game.
    - The quad cutter cuts clockwise starting from the top right!
    - You can download your savegames in the main menu!
    - This game has a lot of useful keybindings! Be sure to check out the
      settings page.
    - This game has a lot of settings, be sure to check them out!
    - The marker to your hub has a small compass to indicate its direction!
    - To clear belts, cut the area and then paste it at the same location.
    - Press F4 to show your FPS and Tick Rate.
    - Press F4 twice to show the tile of your mouse and camera.
    - You can click a pinned shape on the left side to unpin it.
