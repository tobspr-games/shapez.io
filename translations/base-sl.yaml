#  GAME TRANSLATIONS
#
#  Contributing:
#
#    If you want to contribute, please make a pull request on this respository
#    and I will have a look.
#
#  Placeholders:
#
#    Do *not* replace placeholders! Placeholders have a special syntax like
#    `Hotkey: <key>`. They are encapsulated within angle brackets. The correct
#    translation for this one in German for example would be: `Taste: <key>` (notice
#    how the placeholder stayed '<key>' and was not replaced!)
#
#  Adding a new language:
#
#    If you want to add a new language, ask me in the discord and I will setup
#    the basic structure so the game also detects it.

        shapez.io je igra grajenja tovarne katere cilj je avtomatiziranje kreiranja in procesiranja vse bolj zapletenih oblik na neskončni ravnini.
        Ob dostavi zahtevanih oblik boste napredovali v igri in odklenili nadgradnje, da boste pospešili tovarno.

        Ko se bo povpraševanje po oblikah povečalo, boste morali prilagoditi svojo tovarno, da bo zadostilo povpraševanju. Ne pozabite na vire, morali pa se boste razširiti čez [b]neskončno ravnino[/b]!

        Kmalu boste morali mešati barve in z njimi barvati svoje oblike - Združite rdeče, zelene in modre barvne vire, da ustvarite različne barve in z njimi barvate oblike, da zadostite povpraševanju.

        V tej igri je 18 progresivnih stopenj (ki vas bodo zaposlile za več ur!), Vendar nenehno dodajam novo vsebino - načrtovanih novosti je veliko!
        Nakup igre vam omogoča dostop do samostojne različice, ki ima dodatne funkcije, prav tako pa boste imeli dostop do novo razvitih funkcij.
