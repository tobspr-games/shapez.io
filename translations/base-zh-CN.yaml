#  GAME TRANSLATIONS
#
#  Contributing:
#
#    If you want to contribute, please make a pull request on this respository
#    and I will have a look.
#
#  Placeholders:
#
#    Do *not* replace placeholders! Placeholders have a special syntax like
#    `Hotkey: <key>`. They are encapsulated within angle brackets. The correct
#    translation for this one in German for example would be: `Taste: <key>` (notice
#    how the placeholder stayed '<key>' and was not replaced!)
#
#  Adding a new language:
#
#    If you want to add a new language, ask me in the discord and I will setup
#    the basic structure so the game also detects it.

        shapez.io 是一个关于建造工厂来自动化生产和合并越来越复杂的图形的游戏。提交任务，制造更复杂的流水线，解锁升级来提升您工厂的运作速度。

        当需求提出时，您需要扩大工厂的规模来满足需求 - 不过不要忘记资源，您会扩张[b]无限的地图[/b]！

        由于纯粹的图形组合很快就会变得无聊，您需要调色并且给您的图形染色 - 混合红黄蓝颜色来生产不同的颜色再给您的图形染色以满足要求。

        本游戏共有18关（会让您忙活几个小时）但是我会不断增加新内容 - 有好多都在策划啦！
