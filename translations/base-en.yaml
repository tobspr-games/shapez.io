#  Placeholders:
#
#    Do *not* replace placeholders! Placeholders have a special syntax like
#    `Hotkey: <key>`. They are encapsulated within angle brackets. The correct
#    translation for this one in German for example would be: `Taste: <key>` (notice
#    how the placeholder stayed '<key>' and was not replaced!)
#
#  Adding a new language:
#
#    If you want to add a new language, ask me in the Discord and I will setup
#    the basic structure so the game also detects it.

    # This is the short text appearing on the steam page
    shortText: shapez.io is a game about building factories to automate the creation and processing of increasingly complex shapes across an infinitely expanding map.

    # This is the text shown above the Discord link

    intro: >-
        Do you like automation games? Then you are in the right place!

        shapez.io is a relaxed game in which you have to build factories for the automated production of geometric shapes. As the level increases, the shapes become more and more complex, and you have to spread out on the infinite map.

        And as if that wasn't enough, you also have to produce exponentially more to satisfy the demands - the only thing that helps is scaling! While you only have to process shapes at the beginning, you will later have to color them - by extracting and mixing colors!

        Buying the game on Steam gives you access to the full version, but you can also play a demo at shapez.io first and decide later!

        Oh crap. I really should sleep, but I think I just figured out how to make a computer in shapez.io

        This game has stolen my life and I don't want it back. Very chill factory game that won't let me stop making my lines more efficient.

        instructions:
            - 1. Place <strong>Constant Producers</strong> to provide shapes and colors to the player
            - 2. Build one or more shapes you want the player to build later and deliver it to one or more <strong>Goal Acceptors</strong>
            - 3. Once a Goal Acceptor receives a shape for a certain amount of time, it <strong>saves it as a goal</strong> that the player must produce later (Indicated by the <strong>green badge</strong>).
            - 4. Click the <strong>lock button</strong> on a building to disable it.
            - 5. Once you click review, your puzzle will be validated and you can publish it.
            - 6. Upon release, <strong>all buildings will be removed</strong> except for the Producers and Goal Acceptors - That's the part that the player is supposed to figure out for themselves, after all :)

            You unlocked <strong>logic gates</strong>! You don't have to be excited about this, but it's actually super cool!<br><br>
            With logic gates you can now compute AND, OR, XOR and NOT operations.<br><br>
            As a bonus on top I also just gave you a <strong>transistor</strong>!

    reward_virtual_processing:
        title: Virtual Processing
        desc: >-
            I just gave a whole bunch of new buildings which allow you to <strong>simulate the processing of shapes</strong>!<br><br>
            You can now simulate a cutter, rotator, stacker and more on the wires layer!
            With this you now have three options to continue the game:<br><br>
            - Build an <strong>automated machine</strong> to create any possible shape requested by the HUB (I recommend to try it!).<br><br>
            - Build something cool with wires.<br><br>
            - Continue to play normally.<br><br>
            Whatever you choose, remember to have fun!

    # Special reward, which is shown when there is no reward actually
    no_reward:
        title: Next level
        desc: >-
            This level gave you no reward, but the next one will! <br><br> PS: Better not destroy your existing factory - You'll need <strong>all</strong> those shapes later to
            <strong>unlock upgrades</strong>!

    no_reward_freeplay:
        title: Next level
        desc: >-
            Congratulations!

    reward_freeplay:
        title: Freeplay
        desc: >-
            You did it! You unlocked the <strong>free-play mode</strong>! This means that shapes are now <strong>randomly</strong> generated!<br><br>
            Since the hub will require a <strong>throughput</strong> from now on, I highly recommend to build a machine which automatically delivers the requested shape!<br><br>
            The HUB outputs the requested shape on the wires layer, so all you have to do is to analyze it and automatically configure your factory based on that.

            title: Screen Edge Panning
            description: >-
                Allows panning the map by moving the cursor to the edges of the screen. The scroll speed depends on the Movement Speed setting.

tips:
    - The hub will accept any input, not just the current shape!
    - Make sure your factories are modular - it will pay out!
    - Don't build too close to the hub, or it will be a mess!
    - If stacking does not work, try switching the inputs.
    - You can toggle the belt planner direction by pressing <b>R</b>.
    - Holding <b>CTRL</b> allows dragging of belts without auto-orientation.
    - Ratios stay the same, as long as all upgrades are on the same Tier.
    - Serial execution is more efficient than parallel.
    - You will unlock more variants of buildings later in the game!
    - You can use <b>T</b> to switch between different variants.
    - Symmetry is key!
    - You can weave different tiers of tunnels.
    - Try to build compact factories - it will pay out!
    - The painter has a mirrored variant which you can select with <b>T</b>
    - Having the right building ratios will maximize efficiency.
    - At maximum level, 5 extractors will fill a single belt.
    - Don't forget about tunnels!
    - You don't need to divide up items evenly for full efficiency.
    - Holding <b>SHIFT</b> will activate the belt planner, letting you place long lines of belts easily.
    - Cutters always cut vertically, regardless of their orientation.
    - Mix all three primary colors to get white.
    - The storage buffer prioritises the left output.
    - Invest time to build repeatable designs - it's worth it!
    - Holding <b>SHIFT</b> lets you place multiple buildings at a time.
    - You can hold <b>ALT</b> to invert the direction of placed belts.
    - Efficiency is key!
    - Shape patches that are further away from the hub are more complex.
    - Machines have a limited speed, divide them up for maximum efficiency.
    - Use balancers to maximize your efficiency.
    - Organization is important. Try not to cross conveyors too much.
    - Plan in advance, or it will be a mess!
    - Don't remove your old factories! You'll need them to unlock upgrades.
    - Try beating level 20 or 26 on your own before seeking for help!
    - Don't complicate things, try to stay simple and you'll go far.
    - You may need to reuse factories later in the game. Build your factories to be reusable.
    - Sometimes, you can find a needed shape in the map without creating it with stackers.
    - Full windmills/pinwheels can never spawn naturally.
    - Color your shapes before cutting for maximum efficiency.
    - With modules, space is merely a perception; a concern for mortal men.
    - Make a separate blueprint factory. They're important for modules.
    - Have a closer look at the color mixer, and your questions will be answered.
    - Use <b>CTRL</b> + Click to select an area.
    - Building too close to the hub can get in the way of later projects.
    - The pin icon next to each shape in the upgrade list pins it to the screen.
    - Mix all three primary colors to make white!
    - You have an infinite map. Don't cramp your factory, expand!
    - Also try Factorio! It's my favorite game.
    - The quad cutter cuts clockwise, starting from the top right.
    - You can download your savegames in the main menu!
    - This game has a lot of useful keybindings! Be sure to check out the settings page.
    - This game has a lot of settings, be sure to check them out!
    - Your hub marker has a small compass that shows which direction it is in!
    - To clear belts, cut the area and then paste it at the same location.
    - Press F4 to show your FPS and Tick Rate.
    - Press F4 twice to show the tile of your mouse and camera.
    - You can click a pinned shape on the left side to unpin it.
