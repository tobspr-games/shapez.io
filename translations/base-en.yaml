#  GAME TRANSLATIONS
#
#  Contributing:
#
#    If you want to contribute, please make a pull request on this respository
#    and I will have a look.
#
#  Placeholders:
#
#    Do *not* replace placeholders! Placeholders have a special syntax like
#    `Hotkey: <key>`. They are encapsulated within angle brackets. The correct
#    translation for this one in German for example would be: `Taste: <key>` (notice
#    how the placeholder stayed '<key>' and was not replaced!)
#
#  Adding a new language:
#
#    If you want to add a new language, ask me in the discord and I will setup
#    the basic structure so the game also detects it.
