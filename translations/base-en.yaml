#  Contributing:
#
#    If you want to contribute, please make a pull request on this respository
#    and I will have a look.
#
#  Placeholders:
#
#    Do *not* replace placeholders! Placeholders have a special syntax like
#    `Hotkey: <key>`. They are encapsulated within angle brackets. The correct
#    translation for this one in German for example would be: `Taste: <key>` (notice
#    how the placeholder stayed '<key>' and was not replaced!)
#
#  Adding a new language:
#
#    If you want to add a new language, ask me in the Discord and I will setup
#    the basic structure so the game also detects it.

        shapez.io is a game about building factories to automate the creation and processing of increasingly complex shapes across an infinitely expanding map.

        Upon delivering the requested shapes you'll progress within the game and unlock upgrades to speed up your factory.

        As the demand for shapes increases, you'll have to scale up your factory to meet the demand - Don't forget about resources though, you'll have to expand across the [b]infinite map[/b]!

        Soon you'll have to mix colors and paint your shapes with them - Combine red, green and blue color resources to produce different colors and paint shapes with them to satisfy the demand.

        This game features 18 progressive levels (Which should already keep you busy for hours!) but I'm constantly adding new content - There's a lot planned!

        Purchasing the game gives you access to the standalone version which has additional features, and you'll also receive access to newly developed features.
